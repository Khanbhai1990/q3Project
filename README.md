Quarter 3 Project : Admin Dashboard – Created in 4 days, this project follows user activity and analyzes data created by the users. The data includes the user’s info such as age, location, as well as the general pattern of user activity on the website. The dashboard also follows unusual/unsavory behavior from users, with the option to flag them up for their misconducts. From the user-end, the website itself offers 10 Day Challenges for users to interact with.
